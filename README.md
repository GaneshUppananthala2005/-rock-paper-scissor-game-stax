# Smart Rock-Paper-Scissors 🎮

A terminal-based Python game where the computer adapts to your move patterns for a more challenging experience.

## 💡 Project Overview

Instead of playing randomly, the computer learns from your recent moves using a “bigram” prediction model:
- Tracks your last 5 moves.
- Uses those to predict your next choice.
- Chooses the winning counter-move accordingly.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Adaptive AI – counter-intelligence based on your habitual moves.
- 🔁 Continuous gameplay until you type `quit` or `q`.
- 📊 Live score tracking for both player and computer.
- ❌ Input validation with prompts for invalid moves.
